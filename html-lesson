Basic HTML Lessons - hope it helps :)
------------------------

# The basics.
## This will contain the most basic HTML code, good for starters

1. The actual basics, the start.
All HTML files start with ```<!DOCTYPE html>```
Followed by ```<html lang="language">``` (language can be replaced by any, example: ```en```, etc.)
And then ```<head>``` - The head section, where u can add meta to show when you share your link on social media, or just do a stylesheet.

Now, the section you will spend most time in, 
```<body>```
- this section is what the user will see, this is where u do text, images, etc.

when you are finished, end it with ```</body>```
and then end the whole html with ```<html>```

complete example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>test</title>
        <meta property="og:title" content="test">
        <meta property="og:description" content="this is a test. this will show when you share your link, this is an embed, it will show. example: on discord, etc.">
        <meta property="og:image" content="test.png"> 
        <meta property="og:image:width" content="1200">
        <meta property="og:image:height" content="630">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.2/css/all.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.2/css/brands.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="poppins.css">
        <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
        <link rel="icon" sizes="16x16" href="test1.png" type="image/png">
        <link rel="icon" sizes="32x32" href="test.png" type="image/png">
    </head>
    <body>
            <p>This is a test</p>
        <img src="test.img" alt="cool image" width= 70%>
    </body>
    <html>
    



1.1 Text
To put text in html it is with "<p>" and instead of using "</br>" to make a free space on that row u can put "</p>" at the end of the text, example:

<p>This is a test. This is a github repo, learning simple HTML.</p>
<p>This is another test, on another line, on the same repo.</p>

This will show like
```
This is a test. This is a github repo, learning simple HTML.
This is another test, on another line, on the same repo.
```

If you dont use "/" at the end on the <p> it will be like this:
```
This is a test. This is a github repo, learning simple HTML. This is another test, on another line, on the same repo.```
```

OR

<p>This is a test. This is a github repo, learning simple HTML.<p>
</br>
<p>This is another test, on another line, on the same repo.<p>

It will show like this:
```
This is a test. This is a github repo, learning simple HTML.
This is another test, on another line, on the same repo.
```

1.2 Big text // Markdown
Markdown is simple, its like bold, etc.
For bold: <strong> or <b>
<p><strong>This is a test. This is a github repo, learning simple HTML.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is another test, on another line, on the same repo.</strong></p>

For italic: <i>
<p><i>This is a test. This is a github repo, learning simple HTML.<i></p>
<p><i>This is another test, on another line, on the same repo.<i></p>

For big text: <h1>
<h1>Test.</h1>
This goes on, h2 is a bit smaller, but still bold, and big, goes on.

----------------------
2. Images // iFrames

To insert an image that u have a link to it, or locally hosted in the same directory or u can point to it, is easy.

Example:
<img src="/test/image1.png" alt="test image" width=80%>

This will:
- Show the image located in /test/image1.png  -   if your website is on ~/website, then it will look in ~/website/test/image1.png   -   it will start from where your website is, u can go back from it with "../" like "../test2.png", it will go from ~/website to ~ and look for test2.png, and show it

- "alt". if the image doesn't load, for that text to show up

- width, this will change the whole thing, not only width, but also height.



iFrame, embedding a website.

Example:
<iframe src="https://cgcristi.xyz">

This will:
- show the website "https://cgcristi.xyz", you can also resize it with width and height

example:

<iframe src="https://cgcristi.xyz" width=200px height=200px>

important: some websites dont allow u to iframe them, like google.com, etc. - it will just not load

------------------------
3. Links

If you put a link directly in a text, it wont be clickable. example:

<p>This is a test. cgcristi.xyz is a website</p>

- It will show correctly, but it wont be clickable by the user, to make it clickable you do this:

<a href="https://cgcristi.xyz">test</a> 

- This will make it clickable, you can replace the https://cgcristi.xyz with any website, and that "test" it will be what text your link will show, you can just put the domain again.

full example:

<p>This is a test. <a href="https://cgcristi.xyz">cgcristi.xyz</a> is a website</p> 

----------------------------
4. <script>

<script> basically allows you to put js code in your html, so you dont need to have a separate file like animation.js and call it with "<script src="test.js"></script>"

---------------------------
5. Audio

To insert audio you would do,
```
<audio controls>
  <source src="test.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="test-but-in-a-new-format.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```
<audio controls> - controls here will tell it to give controls, there are more options available, like autoplay, mute, etc.
<source src="" type=""> - src is where your audio is, if you dont specify a folder or "../" to go back a folder, it will look in the directory with the html, type is basically what type of audio you have, like audio/ogg, audio/mpeg, etc.
Your browser does not support the audio element. - if a browser can't play audio's/display the audio controls it will say this message to them.

-------------------------
6. Tags, basically the <p>, etc.

There are a lot of tags, below is a link, with all the tags in html, and an short explication:
